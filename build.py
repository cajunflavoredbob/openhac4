"""Builds .c4z driver packages from src/ into dist/.

A .c4z is a zip archive with driver.xml at its root. Each subdirectory of
src/ containing a driver.xml (and a driver.lua) becomes
dist/openhac4_<name>.c4z. The shared common/ Lua modules are packed into every
driver so require() resolves inside the archive.

Version handling: the semver in VERSION is stamped into the {{SEMVER}}
placeholder, and {{VERSION_INT}} gets major*1000000 + minor*1000 + patch so
Composer sees a monotonically increasing integer for update checks (the wide
multipliers avoid collisions like 0.9.100 vs 0.10.0).

The build fails loudly rather than shipping a subtly broken archive: a driver
directory without a driver.xml, a path that driver.xml references but that is
not packed, and two files claiming the same archive name are all hard errors.
Files skipped for their extension are reported so a dropped asset is visible.
